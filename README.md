This purpose of this application is to visualize animal-extinction rates to raise awareness of the increase in extinction-rates in recent times.

There is no one source of data for animal-extinctions. Most of the data we have has been hand-scraped from Wikipedia.
Our API is public and can be queried with GraphQl

Instructions:
Fork/clone
run npm install
run npm start
